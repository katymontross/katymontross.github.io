            <h2>Hi.</h2>
            
            <h3>I’m Katy Montross, photographer of Katy Montross Photo.</h3>
            
            <p>
                I began my journey as a photographer six and a half years ago, after my first baby was born. I have been able to experiment with many different subjects since, and have found that my true passion lies with families, babies, and couples.
            My goal as your photographer is to capture the moments and relationships that mean the most to you. I take pride in bringing out your natural smiles and genuine facial expressions. I want to capture your love, the way your children look at you like your the most important person in the world, your baby’s first smile, the way your life is right. now.
            I look forward to meeting you and capturing your moments, whether big or small!
            </p>
            
            <h3>A little bit about me…</h3>
            
            <p>
                I’m a mother to three wild little boys and a beautiful baby girl. I live for all the pizza, white chocolate Reeses, and chick-flicks. I am an artist and create drawings/paintings on the side. One of my favorite things to do with my little family is to go on drives to different places we’ve never been before, looking around at the beautiful scenery we have so close to us.
            </p>
